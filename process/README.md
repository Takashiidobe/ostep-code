# Overview

Code from OSTEP chapter [Process](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/intro.pdf).

To compile, just type:

```
prompt> make
```

See the highly primitive `Makefile` for details.

Then, run them! Examples:

```
prompt> ./p1
```

```
prompt> ./p2
```

```
prompt> ./p3
```

```
prompt> ./p4
```
